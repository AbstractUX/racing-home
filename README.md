PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This is a racing game I developed using React, Redux, and Bootstrap. The object of the game is to use the arrow keys to avoid crashing into the trees. As the game progresses, the speed of your car increases and there is no way to slow down.

This game also serves as educational material to remind users to drive safely while on the road.
